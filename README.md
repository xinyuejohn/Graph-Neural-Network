# Graph-Neural-Network

Given the citation network `Cora ML` we are going to perform semi-supervised node classification (*transductive learning*), i.e. predict the category for each node given a few labels. Each node represents one publication and each edge a citation. The features represent the bag of words of the respective abstract after stemming and stop word removal. These papers are classified into one of the following seven classes:
- Case Based
- Genetic Algorithms
- Neural Networks
- Probabilistic Methods
- Reinforcement Learning
- Rule Learning
- Theory
